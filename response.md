    # Repository Summary: aks-an-llm

## Overview
This repository contains a CLI tool named `aks` (intentionally misspelled from "ask") designed to facilitate querying a Large Language Model (LLM) about a codebase. The primary LLM used is Grok, developed by xAI, via their API. The tool is optimized for integration with text editors like Neovim or Vim, especially for handling large codebases with thousands of lines, where web interfaces fall short.

The core functionality involves:
- Collecting and concatenating the contents of files in a directory (recursively or selectively).
- Sending the concatenated codebase along with a user query to the Grok API.
- Appending the LLM's response to a file (`response.md`) for reference.
- Supporting various query input methods (command-line, file, or shell history).

This tool is particularly useful for code analysis, debugging, summarization, or asking questions about complex codebases without manual copying/pasting.

## Key Components
- **`README.md`**: Provides documentation, including installation instructions, usage examples, and notes on the tool's purpose.
- **`setup.py`**: A standard Python setup script for packaging and installing the tool via pipx. It defines the package as "aks" with version 1.0.0, authored by Nathan Slager. Dependencies include `openai>=1.0`, and it creates a console script entry point.
- **`aks/main.py`**: The main executable script (entry point: `aks.main:main`). This handles argument parsing, file collection, API interaction, and output. Key features include:
  - File selection: Defaults to recursive globbing for `.cpp`, `.hpp`/`.h`, and `.py` files, or all files with `--all`. Supports custom patterns and exclusions via `--exclude`.
  - Query handling: Accepts queries from command-line arguments, files (`--query-file`), or shell history (`--query-history`).
  - API integration: Uses the OpenAI library to call xAI's Grok API (model: `grok-code-fast-1`). Requires an `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
  - Safety checks: Estimates token usage (rough approximation: chars / 4) and prompts for confirmation if exceeding ~2000 tokens.
  - Output: Responses are appended to `response.md` with metadata (timestamp, query source, etc.).
  - Extras: Includes a spinner for API wait times, debug logging, and error handling.
- **`aks/__init__.py`**: An empty initialization file for the Python package.
- **`tags`**: Appears to be output from Universal Ctags (version 6.1.0), listing tags (functions, variables, classes, etc.) across the codebase for languages like Markdown and Python. This is likely generated automatically for code navigation.
- **`query.md`**: A sample query file containing the text "Summarize this repo".
- **`response.md`**: An empty response file where LLM outputs are accumulated.

## Installation
As described in `README.md`:
1. Clone or navigate to the repo directory.
2. Install via pipx: `pipx install -e .` (installs to `~/.local/bin/aks`).
3. Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH (add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` if needed).
4. Set the `XAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your xAI API key (obtainable from https://console.x.ai/).
5. Test with `which aks`.

## Usage Examples
- Basic query on all files: `aks --all --query "Explain the main function."`
- Using a query file: `aks --all --query-file query.md`
- Excluding files: `aks --all --exclude "*.pyc" --query "Summarize the Python code."`
- Default behavior (C++/Python files): `aks --query "What does this do?"`
- Interactive mode: If no query is provided, prompts for input.

Responses are appended to `response.md` with metadata, allowing for contextual follow-ups by including the file in subsequent queries.

## Architecture and Design
- **Language and Dependencies**: Written in Python 3, using standard libraries (e.g., `os`, `glob`, `argparse`) and the `openai` library for API calls.
- **File Handling**: Files are read, concatenated into a temporary file with separators (`--- filename ---`), then fed to the API. Exclusions use fnmatch for glob matching.
- **API Interaction**: Sends a system prompt setting the AI as Grok, followed by the user prompt containing the codebase and query. Responses are capped at 2000 tokens with temperature 0.7.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for API keys, file readability, and token estimates. Provides debug output for troubleshooting.
- **Limitations**: Assumes UTF-8 encoding; no built-in support for binary files or very large codebases beyond token warnings. Relies on xAI's API availability.

## Potential Improvements
- Add support for other LLMs or APIs.
- Implement caching or incremental updates to avoid re-sending unchanged files.
- Enhance file type detection or add more default globs.
- Include options for response formatting or exporting to other formats.

Overall, this is a lightweight, developer-friendly tool for leveraging AI to analyze and discuss codebases directly from the command line.
